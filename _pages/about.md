My name is Anna Bogdanova. I am a researcher and educator of AI Ethics and Human-Centered AI, particularly interested in the transparency and privacy of machine learning algorithms. I am not a computer scientist by training. I received my Ph.D. in Cultural Studies and had been programming for fun while I worked as an English and STEM educator. 

My encounter with the field of AI started from my involvement with [FRANKEN](http://conclave.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/research/franken/) project led by Professor Claus Aranha at the University of Tsukuba. Later, I was hired as a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Artificial Intelligence Research to help with the Japan-US Project on the development of a distributed privacy-preserving method of machine learning, [Data Collaboration](https://datacollab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/). 

Currently, I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Tsukuba, Graduate Program in Computer Science and the College of Information Science. 
Because of my training in Social Sciences, I am inclined to look at broader social impacts of methods and frameworks that we develop and lead a discussion towards responsible and reliable use of AI.
